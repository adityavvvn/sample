This project is a comprehensive web application designed to help users manage their professional resumes, track job matches, visualize their skills progression with certificates, and showcase their projects. It follows a modern client-server architecture with enhanced data visualization capabilities.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

### 1. Technologies Used

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing a dynamic and responsive experience with modern hooks and state management.
    *   **React Router DOM:** Used for declarative routing in the React application, enabling navigation between different pages with protected routes.
    *   **D3.js:** A powerful JavaScript library for creating enhanced interactive skill graphs with gradient areas, certificate indicators, and professional visualizations.
    *   **Axios:** A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests from the browser to the backend with automatic token management.
    *   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly styling the user interface with modern gradients and responsive design.
    *   **Lucide-React:** A set of customizable React components for popular icons and visual indicators.
    *   **React-to-Print:** Library for generating high-quality PDF resumes with professional formatting.
*   **Backend:**
    *   **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment that allows running JavaScript on the server side.
    *   **Express.js:** A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js, used for building the RESTful API.
    *   **Mongoose:** An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js, providing a straightforward, schema-based solution to model application data.
    *   **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** Middleware to allow or restrict resources requested from another domain.
    *   **Dotenv:** Loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.
    *   **Helmet:** Helps secure Express apps by setting various HTTP headers.
    *   **Morgan:** HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js.
    *   **Express-Rate-Limit:** Basic rate-limiting middleware for Express, used to protect against brute-force attacks.
    *   **Bcryptjs:** A library for hashing passwords securely.
    *   **JSON Web Token (JWT):** Used for creating access tokens that allow secure communication between the client and server after authentication.
*   **Database:**
    *   **MongoDB:** A NoSQL, document-oriented database used to store application data such as user information, jobs, projects, skills, and certificates with complex nested schemas supporting certificate management.
*   **Development & Testing Tools:**
    *   **React Scripts:** A set of scripts used by Create React App for development, building, and testing.
    *   **Nodemon:** A tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes are detected.
    *   **Jest:** A delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
    *   **Supertest:** A super-agent driven library for testing Node.js HTTP servers.

### 3. Project Flow

The application operates as a Single Page Application (SPA) on the frontend, communicating with a RESTful API on the backend.

1.  **User Access:** A user opens the application in their web browser. The `client` (React application) is loaded.
2.  **Authentication:**
    *   If a user is new, they can **Register** by providing credentials. The frontend sends this data to the backend's `/api/users/register` endpoint.
    *   The backend hashes the password using `bcryptjs` and saves the new user to the MongoDB database via Mongoose.
    *   Upon successful registration or login, the backend generates a **JSON Web Token (JWT)**, which is sent back to the frontend.
    *   The frontend stores this JWT (e.g., in local storage) and includes it in the header of subsequent API requests to authenticate the user.
    *   The `AuthContext.js` in the frontend likely manages the user's authentication state.
3.  **Data Interaction:**
    *   Once authenticated, the user can navigate through various pages (e.g., Dashboard, Job Matches, Projects, Skills).
    *   Each page or component that needs data (e.g., list of jobs, user's projects, skill graph data) makes an **API call** to the backend using Axios (via `client/src/utils/api.js`).
    *   For example, to get all projects, the frontend might call `/api/projects`.
    *   The backend's `server.js` receives the request.
    *   The request goes through **middleware** (`server/middleware/auth.js` verifies the JWT for protected routes) and other middleware (e.g., `morgan` for logging, `helmet` for security, `express-rate-limit` for preventing abuse).
    *   The request is then routed to the appropriate **route handler** (e.g., `server/routes/projects.js`).
    *   The route handler interacts with the **MongoDB database** via Mongoose models (`server/models/Project.js`, `Job.js`, `Skill.js`, `User.js`) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
    *   The backend sends the requested data (or a success/error message) back to the frontend as a JSON response.
    *   The frontend updates its UI based on the received data.
4.  **Special Features:**
    *   **Enhanced Skill Visualization:** `EnhancedSkillGraph.js` provides advanced D3.js visualizations with gradient areas, certificate indicators, and professional styling for both interactive and resume modes.
    *   **Certificate Management:** Complete certificate and credential system integrated into skills, allowing users to track professional certifications with issuer details, dates, credential IDs, and verification URLs.
    *   **Project Management & Timeline:** `ProjectTimeline.js` and `Project.js` provide comprehensive project management with timeline visualization and categorization.
    *   **Professional Resume Generation:** `ResumePDF.js` and `ResumeExport.js` generate high-quality PDF resumes with enhanced visuals, certificate integration, and professional formatting optimized for job applications.
    *   **Job Matching:** `JobMatchBoard.js` and `Job.js` provide intelligent job matching based on skills and requirements with percentage calculations.
    *   **Real-time Data Synchronization:** Automatic data refresh between pages ensures certificate counts and skill data stay current across the application.

### 7. Deployment Notes (Render)

- Two services: frontend (React) and backend (Express) deployed on Render.
- Backend environment variables:
  - `MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `NODE_ENV=production`
  - `CLIENT_URLS` (comma-separated list including the frontend URL)
  - `JOOBLE_API_KEY` for external job search
  - Optional rate-limiting: `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`, `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS`
- Frontend environment variables:
  - Optional `REACT_APP_API_URL` pointing to the backend Render URL
  - If omitted, the client auto-detects `*.onrender.com` and targets the backend service URL

### 8. Client API Base URL Behavior

- `client/src/utils/api.js` chooses the base URL in this order:
  1) If hostname contains `onrender.com` (production), force `https://skillspot-backend.onrender.com`
  2) Else if `REACT_APP_API_URL` is set, use it
  3) Else if localhost, use `http://localhost:5000`
  4) Fallback to `http://localhost:5000`
- The Axios instance also attaches `Authorization: Bearer <token>` from `localStorage.token`.

### 9. Backend Caching and ETags

- `server/server.js` disables ETags (`app.set('etag', false)`) and sets `Cache-Control: no-store` on `/api/*`.
- Purpose: avoid 304 Not Modified responses returning empty bodies in some client environments; ensure fresh JSON responses.
- CORS is configured to allow multiple origins via `CLIENT_URLS`; requests with no origin are also allowed (e.g., server-to-server).
